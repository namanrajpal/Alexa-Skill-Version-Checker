# Alexa Skill - Open Source Version Checker

..This is an Alexa Skill that allows users to check for the latest version of their favourite open soruce project.
..REST API used at the backend is contributed by https://verse.pawelad.xyz/

Sample Utterances : 
"Alexa, Ask  version checker, the latest version of python"
"Alexa, Ask version, what is the recent stable for node.js"

Note : Not all the open source projects are currently supported by the API(and thus by the skill) but a work around 
is under process.
